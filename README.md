# Abstract
I tried to make this project as small and simple as possible. Enjoy!

# Scripts

## General.cs
Contains code to clone and customize the "Hexagon"

## Movement.cs
This script is a component of the "Hexagon" object and will be instanciated multiple times when cloned by the code in General.cs
